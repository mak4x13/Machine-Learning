# Machine-Learning
Here are some of my models i trained while learning basics of Machine Learning. 
They may be prone to errors, some have low accuracy but still it made me learn
a lot. From taking start from Linear Regression of supervised learning to K-means
clustering of unsupervised learning I learned a lot. But still, its just the beginning
of a wonderful and exciting ML journey.
